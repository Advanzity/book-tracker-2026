VIDEO SCRIPT - WEEK 02 UNIT TESTING (5-10 MIN)

GOAL
- Explain how the tests validate the C++ code.
- Show Debug (tests) and Release (program).
- Show passing + failing tests.
- Commit in IDE and push to GitHub.

TIMELINE + TALKING POINTS

0:00-0:20 Intro
"This is my Week 02 unit testing walkthrough. I will explain the C++ tests, run Debug vs Release, show a failing test, then commit in Git."

0:20-2:30 Code structure + design decisions
Open week-1.cpp near the _DEBUG block.
Explain:
- _DEBUG controls which main runs. Debug runs doctest main; Release runs interactive main.
- addBook(const Book&) exists to avoid cin and make tests deterministic.
- getTotalPages / getTotalHours / getAvgSpeed / countByDifficulty / getBookCount are pure calculations.
- Methods are const because they do not modify the object.
- Parameters are const references to avoid copies and prevent modification.
- Difficulty is an enum (not string) to restrict valid values and enable switch.
- difficultyToString uses switch (clear discrete cases).
- MAX_BOOKS is static const (class-wide constant, avoids magic numbers).
- Data stays private; tests use public methods instead of exposing fields.

2:30-4:00 Explain test intent (pick 3-4)
- "BookTracker starts empty" checks zero-state and divide-by-zero guard.
- "Single book totals and average" tests the 1-item edge case.
- "addBook rejects invalid input" tests guard logic (negative pages/hours, empty title).
- "Count by difficulty" tests enum-driven decision logic.
- "Average speed uses total pages and hours" tests derived calculation.
Mention that tests cover normal, edge, and guard cases per requirements.

4:00-5:00 Run Debug (tests pass)
- Switch to Debug configuration and run.
- Show doctest output. Say "All tests passed." 
- Mention Debug includes doctest main only.

5:00-6:00 Show a failing test
- Change one expected value (example: expected avg speed 20 -> 21).
- Build + run Debug again.
- Point out failing output (expected vs actual) and why it failed.
- Revert/fix the test, build + run, show all tests passing.

6:00-7:00 Run Release (program mode)
- Switch to Release configuration and run.
- Show the interactive menu.
- Explain that Release does not compile tests because _DEBUG is not defined.

7:00-8:00 Git commit in IDE
- Open Git changes in IDE, show diff quickly.
- Commit with message: "Add doctest unit tests and test-friendly API".
- Push to GitHub.
- Mention: "I will submit the repo link with the video."

8:00-9:00 Wrap-up
"These tests validate calculations, enum logic, struct/array processing, and class methods. Debug verifies correctness automatically; Release runs the normal program."

OPTIONAL EXTRA TALKING POINTS (IF TIME)
- Why struct Book (plain data) vs class.
- Why use array vs vector (class content so far).
- Why functions belong in the class (encapsulation).
- Why a switch is clearer than if/else for enums.

DURING RECORDING CHECKLIST
- Explain code choices, not program features.
- Show tests passing and failing.
- Show Debug and Release behavior.
- Commit in IDE and push.
- Keep under 10 minutes.
