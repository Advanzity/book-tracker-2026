# Book Tracker

![Tests](https://github.com/advanzity/book-tracker-2026/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

This C++ console program tracks books I read. It lets the user add books, view a formatted reading report, and save the report to a file. For Week 02, the project adds unit tests using doctest.

## Features

- Add books with title, pages, hours, and difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- View a formatted report with totals and average reading speed
- Save the report to `report.txt`
- Unit tests for calculations, enum logic, struct/array processing, and class methods

## Build and Run

This project is set up for Visual Studio with Debug and Release configurations.

### Test Mode (Debug / `_DEBUG` defined)

- Build and run **Debug** configuration.
- doctest runs and reports pass/fail results.

### Program Mode (Release / `_DEBUG` not defined)

- Build and run **Release** configuration.
- The interactive menu appears and no tests run.

## Unit Tests (doctest)

Tests cover:

- Calculations: totals and averages (guarded against divide-by-zero)
- Enum decision logic: difficulty label and difficulty counts
- Struct/array processing: processing the `Book` array
- Class methods: non-interactive methods like `addBook`, `getTotalHours`, `getAvgSpeed`, etc.

The test code is compiled only when `_DEBUG` is defined.

## Project Files

- `week-1.cpp` main program + tests (guarded by `_DEBUG`)
- `doctest.h` unit testing framework
- `report.txt` output file generated by the program (created at runtime)

## Notes

- `MAX_BOOKS` is a `static const` to avoid magic numbers.
- Class data stays private; tests use public getters and test-friendly methods.
