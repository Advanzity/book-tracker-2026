# Book Tracker

![Tests](https://github.com/advanzity/book-tracker-2026/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

This C++ console program tracks print and audio books. The code is structured with inheritance and composition:

- Base class: `ReadingItem`
- Derived classes: `PrintBook`, `AudioBook`
- Composition class: `PriceInfo`

## Features

- Add print or audio books with title, pages, hours, difficulty, and pricing
- Polymorphic report output (base + derived details)
- Save the report to `report.txt`
- Unit tests for constructors, getters/setters, derived overrides, and composition helpers

## Build and Run

This project is set up for Visual Studio with Debug and Release configurations.

### Test Mode (Debug / `_DEBUG` defined)

- Build and run **Debug** configuration.
- doctest runs and reports pass/fail results.

### Program Mode (Release / `_DEBUG` not defined)

- Build and run **Release** configuration.
- The interactive menu appears and no tests run.

## Unit Tests (doctest)

Tests cover:

- Constructors initialize fields correctly
- Getters/setters update fields
- Derived classes call base behavior via overridden `print`
- Composition class helper behavior

The test code is compiled only when `_DEBUG` is defined.

## Project Files

- `week-1.cpp` main program + tests (guarded by `_DEBUG`)
- `doctest.h` unit testing framework
- `report.txt` output file generated by the program (created at runtime)

## Notes

- `MAX_ITEMS` is a `static const` to avoid magic numbers.
- Class data stays private/protected; tests use public getters and test-friendly methods.
